It was established in 1973 in order to save tigers from the extreme threat of extinction. This project was made to focus on the preservation of remaining tigers all over the country as well as increase their number through the breeding of species. Around 23 tiger reserves have been made throughout the country for providing the safety and natural environment to them. It was seen a marked improvement in the tiger population by 1993 in the country. However despite the increase in population, the population of tigers in the country is still not satisfactory compared to the effort and money put in the project.\"\"\"\n",
